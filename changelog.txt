Version 0.6
-----------
- show current fpga version in main status view
- autotest feature added (you do not have to press the testbutton anymore the test will be done in a loop)
- added FPGA Version 0xb01b - should work for S15 & T15

Version 0.5
-----------
- added eeprom support (highly experimental)
- cleanup of sd root
- added version check

Version 0.4
-----------
- added binaries and config for S19

Version 0.3
-----------
- added binaries for T17 testing

Version 0.2
-----------
- fix issues with S17 testbinaries (missing library)
- add new test binaries (bmminer from stock firmwares, in some cases they are also doing sanity checks)
- modified some binaries to remove FAN check
- modified single-board-test-S17plus-variantCnoEEPROM so EEPROM is not overwritten when executing the test

Version 0.1
-----------
- Compilation of all single-board-test binaries found in a bunch of testfirmwares and stock firmwares
- redirect output to /tmp/tester.log (and tty, so USB2tty still works)
- modified WebUI
	- FPGA-Version can be selected and flashed (usually BOOT.bin from a stock firmware, be carefull with that! only flash known good BOOT.bin which are compatible with your board or otherwise you will end up having a brick)
	- select Config (stored on SD in the configs folder) you can have multiple Configs prepared and then just chose the desired one
	- select test binary (single-board-test) for specific board/miner types
	- view /tmp/tester.log in the Browser (no need for USB2ttl-Adapter)
	- add possibility to download tester.log 
	- auto scroll tester output
	- start test from WebUI or via IPreport button (or the normal testbutton)
- runs on universal testfixture and S17+ Controlboards
